# Heart Monitor Using IR-Sensor
This folder contains a LabVIEW project that implements a heart rate (BPM) monitoring system using IR (infrared) sensors. The project was carried out as part of my academic work at the University of Montpellier.

## Project Overview
Purpose:
To measure heart rate (BPM) in real time using IR sensors and advanced signal processing techniques implemented in LabVIEW.

## How it Works:
The IR sensor captures a raw analog signal from a fingertip or earlobe. This signal, which contains the heartbeat waveform, is processed in LabVIEW to extract meaningful heart rate data.

## Key Features:

-**Signal Acquisition:** Collects real IR data snapshots during lab sessions.
**Signal Processing:**
  - Noise reduction and filtering to clean up the raw signal.
  - Peak detection algorithms to identify heartbeats.
  - Calculation of BPM from detected peaks.
  - Visualization: Real-time plotting of the signal and detected heartbeats in the LabVIEW front panel.
## Files Included
Project files for LabVIEW (.vi and related files).
## Notes
This project demonstrates the end-to-end process of acquiring, cleaning, and analyzing physiological signals using LabVIEW. All signal processing was performed manually, providing a deeper understanding of the techniques involved in heart rate monitoring.
